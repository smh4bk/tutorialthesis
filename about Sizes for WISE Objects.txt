Name of object
Wavelength - which image was used for this analysis - used R for most images
Major axis and minor axis - units in phy (pixels)
PSF star and PSF Object - use IRAF imexam to determine values
Pixel scale - from header of each image, specifically the image of the wavelength indicated in column 2
Description - of object
Redshifts of the objects - if no redshift is known, used 1 as value
Kpc/" scale - from the header of each image 




**Note: imexam not working properly for W1521, W1703. "Moffat fit did not converge"**
